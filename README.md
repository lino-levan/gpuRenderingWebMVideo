# GPU Rendering Video

A small project that I might come back to in a while that expirements with using canvas with gpu to render individual frames and using whammy to export those frames into webm format.

You can expirement with it here: https://lino-levan.github.io/gpuRenderingWebMVideo/

Note: Due to the limitations of the webm format, this will only work on chrome :(
